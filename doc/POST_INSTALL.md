Fider is now installed, but needs configuring!

Please navigate to https://__DOMAIN____PATH__ to subscribe as administrator on $app!
You'll receive an email on the adress you'll give there. Please click on the link inside.

If you want to customize Fider (e.g use OAuth with Github), please edit __INSTALL_DIR__/custom_fider_env (it might not exist yet).
Don't forget to *export* the variables in this file, just like in a bash script:

export OAUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=<your github secret>
export OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENTID=<your github client id>

You'll find the documentation here for OAuth: https://fider.io/docs/configuring-oauth.
